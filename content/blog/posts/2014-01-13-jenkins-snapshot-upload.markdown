This post will show how to automate the deployment process of a Java Web Application (Student Enrollment Application developed using MYSQL DB with Hibernate ORM in a REST based Jersey2 Spring environment) using Jenkins Continuous Integration - to build the project, run the unit tests, upload the built artifacts to a Sonatype Snapshot repository, run the Cobertura Code Coverage reports and deploy the application to the Amazon EC2. The details of the actual application are explained in the earlier post given by the link [Building Java Web Application Using Jersey REST With Spring](http://meygam.github.io/blog/2013/12/13/student-enrollment-using-jersey-rest-with-spring/).

1. Install Jenkins as a Windows Service
---------------------------------------
Navigate to jenkins-ci.org website using an Internet browser and download the Windows native package (the link is underlined for easy identification) as shown from the right side pane of the Download Jenkins tab. 

![Jenkins Installation package](/assets/images/elizabetht/jenkins-installation.png "Jenkins Installation Package") 

Once the download is complete, uncompress the zip file and click on the jenkins-1.xxx.msi file. Proceed through the configuration steps to install the Jenkins as a Windows service.

2. Modify Default Jenkins Port
------------------------------
By default Jenkins runs on the port 8080. In order to avoid conflict with other applications, the default port can be modified by editing the jenkins.xml found under C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins location. As shown below, modify the httpPort to 8082.

```
<service>
  <id>jenkins</id>
  <name>Jenkins</name>
  <description>This service runs Jenkins continuous integration system.</description>
  <env name="JENKINS_HOME" value="%BASE%"/>
  <!--
    if you'd like to run Jenkins with a specific version of Java, specify a full path to java.exe.
    The following value assumes that you have java in your PATH.
  -->
  <executable>%BASE%\jre\bin\java</executable>
  <arguments>-Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle -jar "%BASE%\jenkins.war" --httpPort=8082</arguments>
  <!--
    interactive flag causes the empty black Java window to be displayed.
    I'm still debugging this.
  <interactive />
  -->
  <logmode>rotate</logmode>

  <onfailure action="restart" />
</service>
```

Once the modification is saved in jenkins.xml file, restart the Jenkins service from the Windows Task Manager->Services and right clicking on the Jenkins service and choose Stop Service to stop the service as shown below. 

![Jenkins Stop Service](/assets/images/elizabetht/jenkins-stop.png "Jenkins Stop Service") 

Once the status of the service changes to stopped, restart the service by right clicking on the Jenkins service and choose Start Service to start the service again.

![Jenkins Restart Service](/assets/images/elizabetht/jenkins-restart.png "Jenkins Restart Service") 

Navigate to localhost:8082 to verify if the Jenkins restart was successful as shown below - Jenkins Dashboard will be displayed. Note that it takes a while before the Jenkins service becomes available.

6. Configure settings.xml
-------------------------
In order to upload the built Maven artifacts to the artifactory server, configure the Jenkins settings.xml found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\tools\hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation\Maven_3.1\conf folder with the same parameters as found in the default settings.xml (usually found under C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.1.0\conf for a Windows machine) of the Maven installation on the system. 

Typically, the server section needs to be configured in the settings.xml for Jenkins matching with the details of the Artifactory server.

```
<servers>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
      <username>username</username>
      <password>password</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
      <username>username</username>
      <password>password</password>
	</server>
</servers>
```

7. Update pom.xml
-----------------
The pom.xml file for the project needs to be configured with the following plugins under the build section for the deployment to snapshot repository and for running the Cobertura Coverage report. 

  - maven-compiler-plugin
  - maven-deploy-plugin
  - cobertura-maven-plugin

Also add parent, scm and developer section to comply with the requirements put forth by the Artifactory server management as shown below.

```
    <parent>
		<groupId>org.sonatype.oss</groupId>
		<artifactId>oss-parent</artifactId>
		<version>7</version>
	</parent>

	<scm>
		<connection>scm:git:git@github.com:elizabetht/StudentEnrollmentWithREST.git</connection>
		<developerConnection>scm:git:git@github.com:elizabetht/StudentEnrollmentWithREST.git</developerConnection>
		<url>git@github.com:elizabetht/StudentEnrollmentWithREST.git</url>
		<tag>StudentEnrollmentWithREST-1.3</tag>
	</scm>
	<developers>
		<developer>
			<id>elizabetht</id>
			<name>Elizabeth Thomas</name>
			<email>email2eliza@gmail.com</email>

	</build>
```

8. Build Now
-------------
Once the above configuration steps are complete, click on "Build Now" under the Jenkins -> Upload REST Snapshot Artifacts (or the respective Job name) to build the project based on the configuration. 

The console output has the detailed logs of what steps were initiated by the configuration and the outcome of the entire build.

The timestamp of the WAR deployed to Amazon EC2 instance can be checked to see if the deployment is successful. In the same way, the snapshot repository can be checked to see if the upload of the artifacts is successful.

Thus the entire process of building the project along with unit tests whenever a SCM change is triggered or under another condition, running code coverage reports, uploading the artifacts built to the snapshot artifactory repository, deploying the WAR to the remote server container and triggering emails to the recipients can be automated with a click of a button through Jenkins.
