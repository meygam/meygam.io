####Microstrategy Enterprise Manager
MSTR Enterprise Manager provides the usage details of the MSTR Intelligence Server. The core of Enterprise Manager is nothing but a MSTR project with set of predefined reports, and the metrics and attributes to create your own reports. You can run reports that help you to:

* Allocate system resources based on data warehouse usage trends
* Research efficient aggregation, partitioning, and indexing strategies
* Profile users based on their system resource usage
* Determine the optimal time to run scheduled jobs, load data, or perform routine system and database maintenance
* Determine the most popular reports so you can schedule and cache them, thus increasing their response time and reducing the load on the system
* Identify unused objects from your metadata repository so they can be deleted later
* Identify peak usage times and patterns and, if necessary, change your Intelligence Server configuration to respond appropriately
* Determine whether you need to add more threads to the database connection threads if queue times are long
* Find which tables are the most used, and create indexes to improve performance

####Microstrategy Integrity Manager
MSTR Integrity Manager is used to automate the report testing.
