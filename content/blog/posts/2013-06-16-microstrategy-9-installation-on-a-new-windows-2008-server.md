Since my customer has decided to go with the Microstrategy(MSTR) as analytics and reporting tool, I got curious about this tool and wanted to know more on its capabilities. I got an opportunity to go for a free training from MSTR, and I got the evaluation CD & a nice notebook. I thought I will install it and explore it for 30 days… Lets see how far I go!

<!--more-->


The installation of actual MSTR seems to be simple, but setting up the windows server for the installtion took more time. It would have been simpler if MSTR gave the VM with MSTR services installed in it. Anyways lets assume we have the Windows Server 2008 ready and let see how to install the MSTR. The prerequites are mentioned in the MSTR website http://www.microstrategy.com/evaluation-edition

###System Requirements
* x86 or x64 compatible CPU
* 4 GB RAM
* Minimum storage space required: Three times the amount of RAM available to Intelligence Server. For example, an Intelligence Server that is provided 4 GB of RAM requires 12 GB of hard drive space.
* Windows 2003 Standard Edition SP2 (on x86 or x64) ,Windows 2003 Enterprise Edition SP2 (on x86 or x64) ,Windows 2003 Standard Edition R2 SP2 (on x86 or x64) ,Windows 2003 Enterprise Edition R2 SP2 (on x86 or x64) ,Windows Vista Business Edition SP2 (on x86 or x64), Windows Vista Enterprise Edition SP2 (on x86 or x64) ,Windows 7 Professional Edition SP1(on x86 or x64), Windows 7 Enterprise Edition SP1 (on x86 or x64) ,Windows 8 all editions (on x86 or x64) ,Windows 2008 Standard Edition SP2 on x64 ,Windows 2008 Enterprise Edition SP2 on x64 ,Windows 2008 Standard Edition R2 SP1 on x64 ,Windows 2008 Enterprise Edition R2 SP1 on x64 ,Windows Server 2012 Standard (on x64)
* Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) * version 6.x, 7.0.x, 7.5.x, or 8.x.
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or 4.5. This must be installed prior to installing MicroStrategy.
* Microsoft Internet Explorer version 7.x, 8.x, 9.x, or 10.x.
* Adobe® Reader® version 9.x, 10.x or 11.x.
* Adobe® Flash® Player version 10.1.x, 10.3.x, or 11.x.
* 16-bit color display or higher
* Windows fonts display set to small fonts (96 dpi)

Insert the DVD and double click on the DVD, it will open the below window, click on "Begin Microstrategy Platform Installation".

Change the installation folders if needed. I prefer it to have the default installation path.

![](/assets/images/2014/Mar/061713_0449_microstrate6.png)

Select the features you want to install. Since I am evaluating I installed all the features except the "Microstrategy office" as it required MS Office to be installed in the server, and I don't have one on my server.

I had to enable the ASP & Windows Authentication services for the IIS as shown below.

Since it's the new server, I didn't get a chance to enable the ASP and ASP.Net extensions in the IIS. Good that MSTR installation recognizes that and showed me the below pop up.

![](/assets/images/2014/Mar/061713_0449_microstrate9.png)

Leave the default and click "Next"

![](/assets/images/2014/Mar/061713_0449_microstrate10.png)

 This is to just an information that you will get the activation key in the mail.

The installation will start now. It took me hours to finish the installation as my VM's processor and memory are under the required specifications.  Select to get the activation code in email. You need to activate the software within 7 days from the installation.

Restart the server to complete the installation

![](/assets/images/2014/Mar/061713_0449_microstrate15.png)

Activate the server using Start à Microstrategy à License Manager

![](/assets/images/2014/Mar/061713_0449_microstrate16.png)

Enter the activation key that you got in the mail.

![](/assets/images/2014/Mar/061713_0449_microstrate17.png)

This completes the Microstrategy Server installation.

![](/assets/images/2014/Mar/061713_0449_microstrate18.png)

The installation should be easy if you have a good server to install it in. I had to struggle to get the VM ready and install MSTR on top of that. That too my VM was about micro in size. Took 3 hours to complete my installation. Better to use a larger VM for quicker installation.
